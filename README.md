# Workerpool

![CI Status](https://github.com/catdevman/workerpool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Not really sure how this happened. Gemini was like do you want to make a workerpool in Go after working on some other things and I was like sure why not maybe I'll learn something and overall this was pretty neat. It was interesting to see how Gemini didn't want to do a lot at once but it clearly had this bigger goal in mind because it keep asking at the end of a task "Would you like to add ...?" and I'm just out here like why not it isn't my glass of water you're buring to do this. :man_shrugging:
